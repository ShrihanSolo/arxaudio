"""Relevance ranking stage.

Instead of one KEEP/DISCARD call per abstract (slow: one LLM round-trip per
paper), we make exactly ONE stateless LLM call that sees ALL fetched paper
*titles* at once, numbered in arrival order, with the user's research interests
(from ``preferences.txt``) as system context. The model scores each title 0–10;
papers are then sorted by score descending. The pipeline takes the top
``MAX_PAPERS`` for full audio treatment and the next block for email-only.

Design constraints (idea.md, PLAN.md):
- One LLM call for the whole batch, context cleared between runs.
- Must work with a tiny local model (qwen2.5:1.5b, 8192-token context), so the
  prompt is short, concrete, and example-anchored, and we only feed titles (not
  abstracts) to stay well inside the context window.
- Never silently lose a paper: parsing is defensive and unscored papers receive
  score 0. On any LLM error we fall back to arrival order (every paper survives,
  just unranked). This is the analogue of filter.py's "default to KEEP" policy.

# Kept deliberately terse and rule-shaped — tiny models follow short, concrete
# instructions far better than prose. ``{preferences}`` is filled per run.
#
# The framing is field-agnostic: a small model latches onto tone and example
# shape more than on content, so the examples show only the OUTPUT FORMAT
# ("N: score") and describe papers abstractly. The only thing that defines
# "relevant" is whatever the user wrote in ``preferences.txt`` — the prompt
# works unchanged for a marine biologist or a particle theorist.

You score a researcher's daily arXiv paper titles by relevance to their stated
interests.

The researcher's interests:
---
{preferences}
---

Score EVERY title from 0 to 10:
  8-10 = strong match: core topic, method, or survey explicitly in interests
  5-7  = related: adjacent field, overlapping method, or survey the researcher follows
  1-4  = tangential: from the right domain but only weakly connected to stated interests
  0    = explicitly in the "not interested in" list, or completely off-topic

Output ONLY lines in the format "N: score". One line per paper. No explanation.
You MUST output exactly one line per paper, even if the score is 0.

Example input:
Titles:
1. Baryon acoustic oscillations in the DESI Year-1 galaxy sample
2. Asteroseismic ages of red giant stars in open clusters
3. Weak lensing shear calibration with image simulations for Rubin LSST
4. Solar wind turbulence measured by Parker Solar Probe
5. Field-level inference of the matter power spectrum with neural networks
6. Machine learning methods for photometric redshift estimation in wide-field surveys
7. Exoplanet transit timing variations in multi-planet systems
8. Chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way bulge from spectroscopic surveys
9. Primordial gravitational waves constraints from CMB B-mode polarization
10. Protein folding dynamics in membrane-bound enzymes

Example output:
1: 8
2: 1
3: 9
4: 0
5: 10
6: 7
7: 2
8: 4
9: 6
